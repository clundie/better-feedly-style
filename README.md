===================

My style sheet for Feedly

Set `feedly.css` as a custom style sheet in your browser.

This changes the look of my Feedly page to suit my preferences. I use the
"Title-Only View" of the Today page.

- Font sizes, line heights, and white space are changed.
- Images are limited to small sizes. You can zoom by hovering.
- Sharing widgets and some other buttons are removed.
