Better style sheet for Feedly

Set `feedly.css` as a custom style sheet in your browser.

I wrote this because Feedly's design wastes a lot of space compared with the way I like to read.

It makes the Feedly display more dense, for example:

- White space is reduced.
- Line heights are reduced.
- Images are limited to small sizes.
- Sharing widgets and some other buttons are removed.
